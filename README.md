# location-tracker

This script / LaunchDaemon combo allows for location based tracking of device usage.  Many parts were borrowed from other scripts, but I can't recall where they all came from .  

This was developed primarily because we have had several students misplace their devices.  iCloud location history is only maintained for 24 hours; this is often not a long enough duration when a computer is lost/stolen over the weekend. 

There is an associated Extension Attribute that pulls recent location history into Casper.  This is used for devices that aren't meant to leave the facility.
